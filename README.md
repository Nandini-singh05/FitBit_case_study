# FitBit_case_study
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.In this case study we will identify potential opportunities for growth and recommendations for the improvement of devices based on trends in their usage. The data set used for this analysis is : FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius).

In this study we looked at trends in activity, daily steps taken, daily number of minutes slept plus daily and hourly calories.
We found out:

1)The number of steps taken by a person is more than recommended i.e. 7500 steps daily every weekday except for sunday, this sudden change in number of steps can affect the number of calories burned by the person. We should add reminders to the devices to remind the user that they have to take at least 7500 steps daily, in the end of the week if the person completes 7500 every weekday we can give them an appreciation message for keeping up the good work.

2)One of the concerning findings of this study was that people are not sleeping the required amount of hours i.e. 8 hours, we need to do additions to the devices to remind the users of the importance of good nights sleep and how it can affect our work and mood throughout the day. We can add some type of game in the system which advances levels only when a person slept 8-9 hours, no less no more.

3)Most of the users are consuming the most calories between 6:00:00 and 8:00:00(peak at 7:00:00).It also shows that users are consuming the least calories around 3:00:00. We add a chart to the display showing the user the amount of calorie intake and calories burned, it can be customized so each user can keep a track of their exercises and eating habits.
            In this section we also found out that there is a positive correlation between the number of steps taken and the calories burned, we should encourage our customers to exercise more on days they consume more calories to take care of their digestion.
 
4)The company still has 33% users who are using the devices for less than a weeks time. It also shows that 50% users are using the devices for more than 3 weeks and 17% of users use the device for a moderate period of 8 to 20 days. In order to retain our customers we can give them perks of using  a device for longer periods we can unlocks some more features of the device and they would be revoked if the person goes back to the previous using habits.
            We can make the products more fashionable and fancy so that they add a touch of elegance, so people can wear them with any outfits because we know the obsession of people to look put together everywhere they go.
